# EncodingConverter
WinForms application to convert encoding of any text file.

This is an open-source program that allows the detection and conversion of the encoding of files.
The idea for the project came actually from the need to convert the encoding of subtitle-files to be able to view it correctly.
Those files, usually of ".srt" file type, are usually written with ANSI encoding. Viewing the text, at least in windows, may sometimes need to change the default encoding of the system to show the text correctly. Viewing the text on a TV will in most cases only show wrong characters.

## Credits
[AHD-Subtitels-Maker](https://github.com/alaahadid/AHD-Subtitles-Maker) is an open-source project for creating/editing/converting of subtitles. One of its sub-projects is [AHD-Encoding-Convertor](https://github.com/alaahadid/AHD-Subtitles-Maker/tree/main/AEC). It handles the conversion of encoding of files. That project provided a basic functionality for the conversion of encoding. Usage of the program, however, was not as streamlined as it might be. This program is inspired by AHD-Encoding-Converter.
