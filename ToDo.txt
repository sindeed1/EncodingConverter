ToDo in this branch (New):

Todo better: write description of the commands that includes the parameters of each commend in the long description of the command.

===============================================================================================================================
>>>Done:
+~ Added/Improved convert command:
	Conver command currently is limited in its usage.
	It has the following syntax:
	
		convert <InputFileName> -ie:<InputEncoding> -oe:<OutputENcoding> <OutputFileName>

	The command neither support optional arguments nor supports advanced arguments like auto detection of encoding.
	A better more robust command will support the above mentioned functions.

+Added support to Console:
The program already supports command line parameters.
For Winforms, however, the console will not show up.
We will have to call, attach a console and maybe free the console before termination
of course we also need to test the implementation!

Currently: Console command works and writes output, when in command line, to the console window.


+Added UI-Feature: Show all detected encodings:
	Currently, when detecting encoding, the presented encoding will be the first one that matches the given
		'Preferred encoding'. The new feature will present all the detected encodings and allow the user to
		select one of it.
	The way I thought about it is to show a buttun on the ToolStrip for each of the encodings.
	The first encoding to  show up will be the one that matches the 'Preferred encoding' string.
	If there is a lot of detected encodings, the tool strip will automatically push them into a DropDown menu.
