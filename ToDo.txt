===================================


ToDo in this branch (New):
Add support to Console:
The program already supports command line parameters.
For Winforms, however, the console will not show up.
We will have to call, attach a console and maybe free the console before termination
of course we also need to test the implementation!

Currently: Console command works and writes output, when in command line, to the console window.

Todo better: write description of the commands that includes the parameters of each commend in the long description of the command.
